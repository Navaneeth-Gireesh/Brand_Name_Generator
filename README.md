# Brand_Name_Generator
The Band Name Generator is a fun and simple Python project designed to generate a unique band name based on user inputs. This project takes the name of the city you grew up in and the name of your pet to create a personalized band name.

# How It Works
1. The program starts by welcoming the user to the Band Name Generator.
2. It then prompts the user to enter the name of the city they grew up in.
3. Next, it asks for the user's pet's name.
4. Finally, the program combines these two inputs and displays the generated band name.
